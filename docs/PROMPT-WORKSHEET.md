### DATA-2

```markdown
**First, review `CLAUDE.md` to understand our project standards and workflow.**

Then refresh your memory by checking `HISTORY_JASON.md`. Review the `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `FUNCTIONAL.md` to understand what we are building.

We are working through `TICKETS.md` and are on ticket DATA-2A (I'm Jason).

**Before implementing anything:**

1. Confirm you understand the current ticket requirements
2. Ask if you should reference any specific standards from `CLAUDE.md`
3. Only implement what's specified in this ticket

As you implement, explain:

- How the code works and why it meets our `FUNCTIONAL.md` requirements
- How it aligns with our `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Why it complies with our standards in `CLAUDE.md`

Now, propose an approach we should take. Be granular and detailed, but do not generate code until we have agreed an approach. When we generate code, we will stop after each smallest useful commitable modification.
```
