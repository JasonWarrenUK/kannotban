# Development History - Jason

## Completed Tickets

### DATA-1: Implement Data Models and Storage âœ…
- Created Task interface in `/src/lib/models/task.ts` with:
  - Core properties: id, title, description, status, createdAt, updatedAt
  - Enhanced features (optional): assignee, priority, dueDate
  - Advanced features (optional): comments, attachments
- Implemented localStorage utilities in `/src/lib/utils/storage.ts`:
  - saveTasks(): Save tasks to localStorage with error handling
  - loadTasks(): Load tasks from localStorage with error handling
  - clearTasks(): Remove tasks from localStorage with error handling
  - isStorageAvailable(): Utility to check if localStorage is accessible
- Created date utilities in `/src/lib/utils/date.ts` using Temporal API:
  - getCurrentTimestamp(): Get current time as milliseconds
  - formatTimestamp(): Format timestamps for display
  - isDueDatePast(): Check if due date has passed
  - isDueDateApproaching(): Check if due date is within 24 hours

## Key Decisions and Patterns

1. **Type System Enhancement**: Used TypeScript types to create more maintainable code:
   - Extracted types like `Status` and `Priority` to improve code consistency
   - Created dedicated types for arrays (Comments, Attachments)

2. **Modern Date Handling**: Adopted Temporal API (via polyfill) instead of the built-in Date:
   - More powerful and intuitive date/time handling
   - Better internationalization support
   - Clearer functions for date comparisons and formatting

3. **Error Handling Patterns**:
   - All localStorage operations wrapped in try/catch blocks
   - Console errors for debugging
   - Clean error messages for user-facing issues
   - Graceful degradation (return empty array if load fails)

## Current State

### Dependencies Added
- @js-temporal/polyfill (v0.5.1): Modern date/time API

### Directory Structure Created
- /src/lib/models/
  - task.ts: Task interface and related types
  - index.ts: Export from models
- /src/lib/utils/
  - storage.ts: localStorage utilities
  - date.ts: Temporal API date utilities
  - index.ts: Export from utils

### Next Planned Work
- DATA-2: Implement Svelte stores for state management
