# Development History - Ryan

## Completed Tickets

### SETUP-2: Create Basic Component Structure
- Created core components: BoardLayout, Column, TaskCard, TaskForm, and ConfirmDialog
- Implemented Tailwind CSS styling for all components
- Structured components according to the architecture pattern
- Established component folder organization with proper exports

### UI-3: Implement Task Form (Partial)
- Created modal TaskForm component with full form functionality
- Implemented validation for required fields
- Added accessibility improvements
- Implemented loading state with spinner
- Added form submission delay for testing UX

## Implementation Details

### Components
- **BoardLayout**: Full-page layout with header, scrollable main content, and footer
- **Column**: Fixed-width container (320px) with title header and scrollable content area
- **TaskCard**: Card displaying task info with status indicators and action buttons
- **TaskForm**: Modal form for creating/editing tasks with validation and loading state
- **ConfirmDialog**: Reusable confirmation dialog for destructive actions

### Design Patterns
- Used Svelte's slot system for component composition
- Followed TypeScript interfaces for props
- Implemented responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Created a "UI" directory for generic components vs. board-specific components

### Accessibility Improvements
- Added proper tabindex and keyboard event handling for dialogs
- Implemented ARIA attributes for modal components
- Improved focus management for better user experience

## Key Configuration Changes
- Added form submission delay (2000ms) for spinner testing
- Removed unnecessary animations for cleaner UX
- Fixed accessibility warnings in task-form component

## Project Organization
- `/src/lib/components/board/` for board-specific components
- `/src/lib/components/ui/` for generic UI components
- Proper index.ts files for clean exports

## Remaining Issues
- TaskCard component has unused export property warning
- Date utility has an error with Temporal.Instant.until method

## Next Steps
- Fix remaining accessibility warnings in Column and TaskCard components
- Complete UI-3 ticket with final refinements
- Implement drag and drop functionality (FUNC-2)
- Connect components to actual data stores
