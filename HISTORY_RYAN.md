# Development History - Ryan

## Completed Tickets

### SETUP-2: Create Basic Component Structure
- Created core components: BoardLayout, Column, TaskCard, TaskForm, and ConfirmDialog
- Implemented Tailwind CSS styling for all components
- Structured components according to the architecture pattern
- Established component folder organization with proper exports

## Implementation Details

### Components
- **BoardLayout**: Full-page layout with header, scrollable main content, and footer
- **Column**: Fixed-width container (320px) with title header and scrollable content area
- **TaskCard**: Card displaying task info with status indicators and action buttons
- **TaskForm**: Modal form for creating/editing tasks with validation
- **ConfirmDialog**: Reusable confirmation dialog for destructive actions

### Design Patterns
- Used Svelte's slot system for component composition
- Followed TypeScript interfaces for props
- Implemented responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Created a "UI" directory for generic components vs. board-specific components

## Project Organization
- `/src/lib/components/board/` for board-specific components
- `/src/lib/components/ui/` for generic UI components
- Proper index.ts files for clean exports

## Next Steps
- Implement data models and stores (DATA-1, DATA-2)
- Connect components to actual data
- Implement drag and drop functionality

No significant deviations from specifications have been made at this point.
